A basic Selenium WebDriver Maven template developed by cchang for automation teams to get started.

===== FIRST THINGS FIRST ======

=== Pre-Conditions:

=== Install TestNG:
1) Help > Eclipse Marketplace

1) Right click main project > Properties
2) Click "Java Build Path" on the left
3) Click "Libraries" tab
4) Click the JRE option (e.g. JRE System Library) once and then click "Edit"

=== Run "clean..."
1) On top of eclipse, run Project > clean...

====== HOW TO: ======

=== Run a test:
1) Create your class in the "automated.tests" package located here: src/test/java/automated.tests. You can use "SmokeTest.java" as a template.
2) Add this class into the testng.xml file
3) Right click pom.xml and "Run As" then run the maven commands (clean, install, test)
